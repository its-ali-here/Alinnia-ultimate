How do I resolve?

Hello! As a coding partner, I can certainly help you with your coding-related tasks.

Based on the screenshot you provided, it looks like you're encountering a build failure on Vercel. Let's break down the error and figure out how to fix it.

Overview of the Solution

The primary issue seems to be a mismatch between your pnpm-lock.yaml file and your package.json file. This is indicated by the error message: ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date with <rootDir>/package.json.

The frozen-lockfile setting is often used in continuous integration (CI) environments like Vercel to ensure that the exact versions of dependencies specified in the lockfile are installed. When there's a discrepancy, the build fails to prevent unexpected behavior from different dependency versions.

Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:

Step 1: Update Your Lockfile Locally

First, you need to update your pnpm-lock.yaml file to be in sync with your package.json. You can do this by running the following command in your local development environment:

Bash
pnpm install
This command will read your package.json, install the correct versions of the dependencies, and update pnpm-lock.yaml accordingly.

Step 2: Commit the Changes

After running pnpm install, you'll notice that pnpm-lock.yaml has been modified. You need to commit this change to your Git repository:

Bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "chore: update pnpm-lock.yaml"
Step 3: Push to Your Git Repository

Finally, push the committed changes to your GitHub repository.

Bash
git push
Once you push the changes, Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment with the updated lockfile, which should resolve the build error.

Additional Recommendations

.gitignore: The error log also shows a warning: WARNING: You should not upload the .next directory.. The .next directory is a build artifact and should not be version-controlled. Ensure that your .gitignore file includes a line for .next/. I see that your .gitignore file is currently empty.
Here is a recommended .gitignore for a Next.js project:

# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring files.

# dependencies

.pnp.js

# testing
/coverage
